# search-gmail-using-message-id
The emacs-lisp function is to search gmail using a Message ID.

## Purpose of the function
While we are sending and receiving so many emails a day, it is almost impossible to organize them by grouping and storing them in different folders. People usually do not make specific enough email subjects and there are many automated emails due to your personal subscription. Even though, some important emails need to be saved in special locations, but sometime one email falls into multiple categories and therefore copying/storing it in multiple folder only gives us confusion.

## What is the Message ID and how do you use it?
Now we can use a unique digital information of your emails to quickly find specific ones.  Each email has its own identification, called Message ID, which is similar to your mail address, but very long account name. such as

`<806d9c0c-ffe2-7c3b-5775-f0ae1cd2b5da@gmail.com>`

### How do you find your Message ID of a specific gmail?
In Gmail, you can find your Message ID by clicking an icon of three vertical dots and select "Show original".

### How do you search in Gmail using the Message ID?
In Gmail search window, you can type and enter

`rfc822msgid:806d9c0c-ffe2-7c3b-5775-f0ae1cd2b5da@gmail.com`

Note that you need to remove brackets "<" and ">", enclosing the Message ID and attach it to "rfc822msgid:".
Copy this to your Gmail search window and you can immediately find the mail that you want to retrieve.

## A unique URL of a Message ID for Gmail
Instead this link also works in much convenient way:

`https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/rfc822msgid%3A806d9c0c-ffe2-7c3b-5775-f0ae1cd2b5da%40gmail.com`

In `https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/rfc822msgid%3A`, 
note that you have `https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/` in front of `rfc822msgid:`
`:` symbol is replaced by `%3A`
`@` symbol in the Message ID is replaced by `%40`.

## Summary
A unique gmail link can be made by putting two parts together, i.e.,

`https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/rfc822msgid:` and `806d9c0c-ffe2-7c3b-5775-f0ae1cd2b5da@gmail.com`

and replacing ":" by "%3A" in the link prefix and "@" by "%40" in the Message ID to finally generate

https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/rfc822msgid<strong>%3A</strong>806d9c0c-ffe2-7c3b-5775-f0ae1cd2b5da%40gmail.com

Note that "<strong>0</strong>" in '.../mail/u/<strong>0</strong>/#search/...' means your primary gmail account.  If you have multiple gmail acount, the <strong>second</strong> and the <strong>third</strong> accounts are specified using '.../mail/u/<strong>1</strong>/#search/...' and '.../mail/u/<strong>2</strong>/#search/...' , respectively. 

# Conclusion 
I believe using a Message ID will significantly shorten the searching time since you will have only one result, and therefore can reduce the server load as well. My simple Emacs-lisp code automatically generates the gmail link from the Message ID. I personally use Thunderbird and the latest version has an add-on called "ID copy Message ID", which does that the name indicates. Most email software programs have specific ways to show the Message ID. Not only Emacs, but if you know how to use regular expressions, the converting script is not hard to generate.

Enjoy saving time.
